## Bash variables and startup configuration files

_Variables_ in most computer programs are short term memory storage for the different types of data of a programming language. 

In the case of the Linux shell, the values stored inside a variable can later be used as a reference for the command arguments we already know.

By the end of this course you'll be able to: 

- Create your own variables
- Persist variables across different shell sessions
- Modify some of the Linux shell environment variables
- Use variables for string interpolation
- Store command outputs on variables
- Understand the differences between *.bash_profile* and *.bashrc* startup files
