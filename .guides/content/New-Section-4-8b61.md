### Environment variables

Codio's CLI runs inside a UNIX operating system environment. UNIX terminals are assigned special variables named with CAPITAL_LETTERS called _environment variables_.

Environment variables determine a vast list of the system configuration settings.

For example, the `PS1` variable determines how your command prompt should look and what to display.### Environment variables
