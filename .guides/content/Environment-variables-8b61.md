Codio's CLI runs inside a Linux operating system environment. 

Linux terminals are assigned special variables named with UPPERCASE_LETTERS called _environment variables_.

_Environment variables_, also called _Shell Variables_, determine a vast list of the system configuration settings.

|||info
### Environment variables values
Get a list of the _environment variables_ by executing:
```
env
```

__NOTE:__ Environment variables default values and details are displayed by the `man bash` manual pages down on the __Shell Variables__ section.
